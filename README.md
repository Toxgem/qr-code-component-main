## My process

This is my first time using Git to make a repository for a project so it's my first baby steps, i've being doing a few projects of my own but haven't published like this, so since I'm new still to programming I struggle quite a bit with the css file, there was much of trial and error, kinda eye measuring things, using dev tools and a lot of googling things

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

@import tag

One of the few things that i learned about in this challenge was the @impor tag for css
I've been using the <link rel...> format to import any font untill now, a new thing to collect
```



### Continued development

I am still struggling with  CSS styling so i am still looking for a personal look, something that can be made my own, but for now i'll will try to code a few new things to get better.

I am looking for future feedback, I will receive any sugestions for improvements
